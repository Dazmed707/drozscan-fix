### Drozscan is just an automated script to run all drozer commands in a single run. See the results in CLI, JSON or HTML.

## NOTE : Make sure you installed and configured the [drozer](https://labs.f-secure.com/tools/drozer/) tool before running the script. I test in virtual-enviroment with python 3.8.10.
